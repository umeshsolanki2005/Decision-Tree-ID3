# Decision-Tree-ID3
In this task I implemented the ID3 Decision Tree algorithm from scratch in Python, utilizing concepts such as entropy, information gain, and recursive tree construction. My implementation consists of a Node class to define tree nodes and a DecisionTree class that handles tree growth based on the best feature splits. The model selects the optimal splits by calculating information gain and recursively builds the tree until a stopping condition is met. I trained the model on the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets, split the data into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio, and tested its performance. The model achieved an accuracy of 91.23% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classification tasks.
